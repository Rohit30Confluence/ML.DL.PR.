# ML.DL.PR.
# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a neural network for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the training script:
   python src/train.py
   
4. Explore the results in Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook notebooks/exploration.ipynb


**Conclusion**
This project provides a solid foundation for understanding deep learning and pattern recognition. You can expand it further by implementing more complex architectures, adding data augmentation, or exploring transfer learning.
